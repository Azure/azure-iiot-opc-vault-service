Si votre pays n’autorise pas l’exclusion ou la limitation de responsabilité pour les dommages indirects, accessoires ou de quelque nature que ce soit, il se peut que la limitation ou l’exclusion ci-dessus ne s’appliquera pas à votre égard.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions.

Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks.

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS
MICROSOFT .NET LIBRARY 
These license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates) and you. Please read them. They apply to the software named above, which includes the media on which you received it, if any. The terms also apply to any Microsoft
·         updates,
·         supplements,
·         Internet-based services, and
·         support services
for this software, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those terms apply.
BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THEM, DO NOT USE THE SOFTWARE.
IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE PERPETUAL RIGHTS BELOW.
1.    INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS. 
a.    Installation and Use. You may install and use any number of copies of the software to design, develop and test your programs.  You may modify, copy, distribute or deploy any .js files contained in the software as part of your programs.
b.    Third Party Programs. The software may include third party programs that Microsoft, not the third party, licenses to you under this agreement. Notices, if any, for the third party program are included for your information only.
2.    ADDITIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR USE RIGHTS.
a.    DISTRIBUTABLE CODE.  In addition to the .js files described above, the software is comprised of Distributable Code. “Distributable Code” is code that you are permitted to distribute in programs you develop if you comply with the terms below.
i.      Right to Use and Distribute. 
·         You may copy and distribute the object code form of the software.
·         Third Party Distribution. You may permit distributors of your programs to copy and distribute the Distributable Code as part of those programs.
ii.    Distribution Requirements. For any Distributable Code you distribute, you must
·         use the Distributable Code in your programs and not as a standalone distribution;
·         require distributors and external end users to agree to terms that protect it at least as much as this agreement;
·         display your valid copyright notice on your programs; and
·         indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims, including attorneys’ fees, related to the distribution or use of your programs.
iii.   Distribution Restrictions. You may not
·         alter any copyright, trademark or patent notice in the Distributable Code;
·         use Microsoft’s trademarks in your programs’ names or in a way that suggests your programs come from or are endorsed by Microsoft;
·         include Distributable Code in malicious, deceptive or unlawful programs; or
·         modify or distribute the source code of any Distributable Code so that any part of it becomes subject to an Excluded License. An Excluded License is one that requires, as a condition of use, modification or distribution, that
·         the code be disclosed or distributed in source code form; or
·         others have the right to modify it.
3.    SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not
·         work around any technical limitations in the software;
·         reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, except and only to the extent that applicable law expressly permits, despite this limitation;
·         publish the software for others to copy;
·         rent, lease or lend the software; or
·         transfer the software or this agreement to any third party.
4.    BACKUP COPY. You may make one backup copy of the software. You may use it only to reinstall the software.
5.    DOCUMENTATION. Any person that has valid access to your computer or internal network may copy and use the documentation for your internal, reference purposes.
6.    EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. The software is subject to United States export laws and regulations. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software. These laws include restrictions on destinations, end users and end use. For additional information, see www.microsoft.com/exporting.
7.    SUPPORT SERVICES. Because this software is “as is,” we may not provide support services for it.
8.    ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.
9.    APPLICABLE LAW.
a.    United States. If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles. The laws of the state where you live govern all other claims, including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort.
b.    Outside the United States. If you acquired the software in any other country, the laws of that country apply.
10.  LEGAL EFFECT. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your country. You may also have rights with respect to the party from whom you acquired the software. This agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your country if the laws of your country do not permit it to do so.
11.  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS-IS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL CONSUMER RIGHTS OR STATUTORY GUARANTEES UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS WHICH THIS AGREEMENT CANNOT CHANGE. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
FOR AUSTRALIA – YOU HAVE STATUTORY GUARANTEES UNDER THE AUSTRALIAN CONSUMER LAW AND NOTHING IN THESE TERMS IS INTENDED TO AFFECT THOSE RIGHTS.
12.  LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.
This limitation applies to
·         anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and
·         claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.
It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.
Please note: As this software is distributed in Quebec, Canada, some of the clauses in this agreement are provided below in French.
Remarque : Ce logiciel étant distribué au Québec, Canada, certaines des clauses dans ce contrat sont fournies ci-dessous en français.
EXONÉRATION DE GARANTIE. Le logiciel visé par une licence est offert « tel quel ». Toute utilisation de ce logiciel est à votre seule risque et péril. Microsoft n’accorde aucune autre garantie expresse. Vous pouvez bénéficier de droits additionnels en vertu du droit local sur la protection des consommateurs, que ce contrat ne peut modifier. La ou elles sont permises par le droit locale, les garanties implicites de qualité marchande, d’adéquation à un usage particulier et d’absence de contrefaçon sont exclues.
LIMITATION DES DOMMAGES-INTÉRÊTS ET EXCLUSION DE RESPONSABILITÉ POUR LES DOMMAGES. Vous pouvez obtenir de Microsoft et de ses fournisseurs une indemnisation en cas de dommages directs uniquement à hauteur de 5,00 $ US. Vous ne pouvez prétendre à aucune indemnisation pour les autres dommages, y compris les dommages spéciaux, indirects ou accessoires et pertes de bénéfices.
Cette limitation concerne :
·         tout ce qui est relié au logiciel, aux services ou au contenu (y compris le code) figurant sur des sites Internet tiers ou dans des programmes tiers ; et
·         les réclamations au titre de violation de contrat ou de garantie, ou au titre de responsabilité stricte, de négligence ou d’une autre faute dans la limite autorisée par la loi en vigueur.
Elle s’applique également, même si Microsoft connaissait ou devrait connaître l’éventualité d’un tel dommage. Si votre pays n’autorise pas l’exclusion ou la limitation de responsabilité pour les dommages indirects, accessoires ou de quelque nature que ce soit, il se peut que la limitation ou l’exclusion ci-dessus ne s’appliquera pas à votre égard.
EFFET JURIDIQUE. Le présent contrat décrit certains droits juridiques. Vous pourriez avoir d’autres droits prévus par les lois de votre pays. Le présent contrat ne modifie pas les droits que vous confèrent les lois de votre pays si celles-ci ne le permettent pas.

	of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
	as modifying the License.
	
	You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
	may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
	for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

	implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
	of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
	PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
	
	8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
	whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

	Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
	excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
	designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
	
	"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
	on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
	subsequently incorporated within the Work.
	
	2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
	this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
	worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
	copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
	publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
	Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
	
	3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
	this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
	worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
	(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
	use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
	where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
	by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
	Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
	with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
	institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
	cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
	or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
	or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
	granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
	as of the date such litigation is filed.
	
	4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
	Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
	modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
	meet the following conditions:
	
	(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
	Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
	
	(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
	stating that You changed the files; and
	
	(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
	that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
	attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
	excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
	the Derivative Works; and
	
	(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
	distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
	include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
	within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
	as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
	documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
	within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
	as modifying the License.
	
	You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
	may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
	for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
	for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
	reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	the conditions stated in this License.
	
	5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
	this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
	
	6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
	names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
	except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
	origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
	
	7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
	agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
	Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
	WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
	implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
	of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
	PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
	
	8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
	whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
	
	9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
	and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
	or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
	License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
	on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
	of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
	defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
	incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
	of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
	
	END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
